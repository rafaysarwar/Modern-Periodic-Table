Hydrogen(H):

element name: Hydrogen
Symbol (H)
atomic mass: 1.00784u
atomic no.: 1
chemicallay active: (no)
history:In 1671, Robert Boyle discovered and described the reaction between iron filings and dilute acids, 
which results in the production of hydrogen gas.[63][64] In 1766, Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize hydrogen gas as a discrete substance, by naming the gas from a metal-acid reaction "inflammable air"

Lithium(Li):

Symbol: Li
Atomic number: 3
Atomic mass: 6.941 u
element name: Lithium
chemicallay active: (yes)
History:AlSi4O10) was discovered in 1800 by the Brazilian chemist and statesman José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva in a mine on the island of Utö, Sweden.[62][63][64][65] However,
 it was not until 1817 that Johan August Arfwedson, 
detected the presence of a new element while analyzing petalite ore.[66][67][68][69]

Sodium(Na):

Symbol: Na
Atomic mass: 22.989769 u
Atomic number: 11
element name: Sodium
chemicallay active: (yes)
History: In1807 by Sir Humphry Davy through the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide.[34][35] In 1809, the German physicist and chemist Ludwig Wilhelm Gilbert proposed the names.
The chemical abbreviation for sodium was first published in 1814 by Jöns Jakob Berzelius in his system of atomic symbols,[37][38] and is an abbreviation of the element's New Latin name natrium, 

Potassium(K):

Symbol: K
Atomic mass: 39.0983 u
Atomic number: 19
element name:Potassium 
chemicallay active: (yes)
History:The symbol "K" stems from kali, 
itself from the root word alkali,
 which in turn comes from Arabic: which means "plant ashes". In 1797, the German chemist Martin Klaproth discovered "potash" in the minerals leucite and lepidolite
 In 1807, Humphry Davy produced the element via electrolysis called potassium.

Rubidium(Rb):

Symbol: Rb
Atomic number: 37
Atomic mass: 85.4678 u
element name:Rubidium
chemicallay active: (yes)(radio active)
History:
Histroy:Rubidium was discovered in 1861 by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff, in Heidelberg, Germany, 
in the mineral lepidolite through flame spectroscopy. Because of the bright red lines in its emission spectrum, 
they chose a name derived from the Latin word rubidus, meaning "deep red".[27][28].

Caesium(Cs):

Symbol: Cs
Atomic number: 55
Atomic mass: 132.90545 u
element name:Caesium
chemicallay active: (yes)(radio active)
History:The German chemist Robert Bunsen and physicist Gustav Kirchhoff discovered caesium
in 1860 by the newly developed method of flame spectroscopy. The first small-scale applications for caesium were as a "getter" in vacuum tubes and in photoelectric cells.

Francium(Fr):

Symbol: Fr
Atomic number: 87
Atomic mass: 223u
element name:Francium
chemicallay active: (yes)(radio active)
History:Francium was discovered by Marguerite Perey in France (from which the element takes its name) in 1939.[3] 
It was the last element first discovered in nature,
with trace amounts found in uranium and thorium ores, where the isotope francium-223 continually forms and decays.
